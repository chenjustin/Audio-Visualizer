# Audio-Visualizer

Customizable audio visualizers created with the Web Audio API + HTML5 Canvas. An audio visualizer generates animated imagery based on audio input.
This will require your browser's permission for microphone access to work.

How to use with sound-card input:
---
1.  Open Windows sound settings
2.  Click on the "Recording" tab
3.  Set the default device to "Stereo Mix"

The visualizer should now respond to your PC's sound output. Try watching the visuals while listening to some sick tunes :)

If you don't see Stereo Mix listed as a recording device, right click the page and check "Show Disabled Devices".

Here are some screenshots of the "Frequency Bars" visualization
