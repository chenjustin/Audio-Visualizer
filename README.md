How to use
---
1.  Open Windows sound settings
2.  Click on the "Recording" tab
3.  Set the default device to "Stereo Mix"

The visualizer should now respond to your PC's sound output. Try watching the visuals while listening to some nice tunes :)

If you don't see Stereo Mix listed as a recording device, right click the page and check "Show Disabled Devices".

Here are some screenshots of the "Frequency Bars" visualization
